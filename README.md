Data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone


I merge two files X_test.txt and X_train.txt. I copied the columns containing means (averages) and standard deviations.
This was saved into a the file TidyData.csv. There are 65 columns in this data.

Then I took the average of each measurement and saved it in a table names AverageTable.csv.
